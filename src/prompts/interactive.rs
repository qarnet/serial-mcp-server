\n\
- Append `{line_ending}` to every line the user wants to send.\n\
- After each `write`, call `wait_for(connection_id=\"{id}\", pattern={prompt}, \
timeout_ms=2000)` to read the response up to {prompt}.\n\
- If `wait_for` returns an error about timeout, surface the partial buffer and ask the user \
how to proceed instead of retrying blindly.\n\
- Decode the response data as UTF-8 unless it contains bytes the codec rejects, in \
which case fall back to hex and tell the user.\n\
- Never call `close` unless the user explicitly says so.\n\
- If the connection vanishes (tool returns Connection ID not found), tell the user \
and stop; do not silently reopen.\n\
\n\
Begin by sending an empty line (write `{line_ending}` then wait_for) to surface the \
current prompt, then report back and wait for the user's first command.",
