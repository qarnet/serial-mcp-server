## Detailed Breakdown by Priority

### ✅ Production Ready (Critical Path Complete)

All features required for a functional MCP server:

- [x] Tool discovery and invocation (11 tools)
- [x] Tool titles and annotations
- [x] Resource CRUD with text + blob
- [x] Prompt templates with completions
- [x] Logging / notifications
- [x] Resource subscriptions and change notifications
- [x] Progress notifications for long-running tools
- [x] Cancellation support for long-running tools
- [x] Protocol version 2025-11-25
- [x] Both transports (stdio + HTTP)
- [x] Error handling (two-tier)
- [x] Hardware tested (CDC-ACM)
- [x] 70+ tests passing

### ⚠️ Partial / Needs Review

Features with structure but incomplete:

- [ ] Pagination (accepts cursor, returns all)
- [ ] Tool outputSchema (spec says optional)
- [ ] Resource metadata (size, annotations, icons — optional)
- [ ] Task support (infrastructure exists, not wired — experimental)

### ❌ Missing (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Pagination logic (not yet implemented in list_resources/list_tools/list_prompts)
- [ ] Tool output schemas
- [ ] Resource `size` field
- [ ] Resource `annotations` (audience, priority)
- [ ] Resource `icons`
- [ ] Full task support (experimental in spec)

### 🚫 Deprecated (Correctly Skipped)

- [ ] Sampling (`sampling/createMessage`) — SEP-2577
- [ ] Roots (`roots/list`) — SEP-2577
- [ ] Legacy HTTP+SSE transport — Replaced by Streamable HTTP

## Recommendations for Future Work

### High Impact, Low Effort

1. **Pagination** (~2 hours)
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for list operations
   - Use base64-encoded offset as cursor
   - Only relevant if system has 100+ serial ports

2. **Resource Metadata** (~1 hour)
   - Add `size` to `serial://ports` (port count)
   - Add `size` to `serial://connections` (connection count)

### Medium Impact, Medium Effort

3. **Tool Output Schemas** (~2 hours)
   - Annotate response types with `outputSchema`
   - Improves client validation and LLM understanding

4. **Task Support** (~4 hours)
   - Decide whether to fully implement or remove dead code
   - Wire `OperationProcessor` or remove it
   - Tasks are experimental in 2025-11-25

### Low Impact / Wait for Spec Stabilization

5. **Resource annotations/icons** — Not needed for serial use
6. **Elicitation** — Not relevant for serial server
7. **Structured Content** — Current `Json<T>` approach sufficient
